# AmoebotSim

Welcome to AmoebotSim, a visual simulator for the [amoebot model](https://sops.engineering.asu.edu/sops/amoebot) developed by the [Self-Organizing Particle Systems (SOPS) Lab](https://sops.engineering.asu.edu/) at Arizona State University and the University of Paderborn. The amoebot model is an abstraction of _programmable matter_, a material that can dynamically change its physical properties (e.g., shape, size, color, etc.) based on user input or stimuli from its environment. This simulator is designed for researchers who want to:

- Visualize and learn about current distributed algorithms for the amoebot model
- Experiment with new ideas for amoebot model algorithms
- Perform validation and runtime testing for new or existing amoebot model algorithms


## Installation Guide

The latest standalone version of AmoebotSim is available for download [here](https://bitbucket.org/gmyr/amoebotsim/downloads/). A full guide to installing and configuring AmoebotSim can be found on the corresponding [wiki page](https://bitbucket.org/gmyr/amoebotsim/wiki/Installation%20Guide).


## Usage

A complete walkthrough of using the simulator's GUI, including a list of hotkeys and script commands, can be found on the corresponding [wiki page](https://bitbucket.org/gmyr/amoebotsim/wiki/Usage).


## Contributing to AmoebotSim

If you're interested in contributing to this ongoing project, feel free to fork this repository and create a branch for your new feature. When you're done developing your changes, [create a pull request](https://bitbucket.org/gmyr/amoebotsim/pull-requests/new) for your branch and list one of our [admins](https://bitbucket.org/gmyr/amoebotsim/wiki/Contact) as the reviewer.

## Credits

AmoebotSim was originally created by [Robert Gmyr](https://gmyr.net) during his PhD studies at the University of Paderborn, and is now actively maintained by [Joshua J. Daymude](https://joshdaymude.wordpress.com) and Kristian Hinnenthal, current PhD students in the SOPS Lab. Many other hands have helped (or are currently helping) build AmoebotSim.
