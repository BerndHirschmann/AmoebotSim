# Welcome to AmoebotSim, a graphical simulator for the Amoebot model. #

To get started, please proceed as follows.
1. Download and install the latest version of Qt [1]. In my experience, the online installer for the respective OS works best. On windows, please make sure to use the MinGW platform (there are checkboxes under "Qt 5.x.x" and under "Tools") and not MSVC. In general, the additional platforms (Android, iOS, ...) are not required and can be left out to decrease the size of the installation.
2. Clone this repository using Git. If you want to use a GUI-Application for Git and you are on OS X or Windows, I can recommend Source Tree [2].
3. In the cloned repository, simply double-click the file "AmoebotSim.pss" to open the project in Qt Creator.
4. Choose your build directories.
5. Run AmoebotSim by pressing the green "play"-button in the bottom left corner.
