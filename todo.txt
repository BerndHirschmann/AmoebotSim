Todos:
- implement screenshot functionality
- get rid of performance problems caused by the mutex in View
- evaluate whether moving the implementation to vertex buffers might be worth-while
  - then it should also be possible to pull the System mutex inside the class
- evaluate whether moving the implementation to std::unordered_map for the particle map would be useful
- update readme file after simulator overhaul


Ideas:
- history, going forwards and backwards in time
- support for 3D
- move spanning forest implementation into separate class
