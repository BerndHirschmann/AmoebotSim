Exporting notes for textures in particle.svg (when using Inkscape v0.92+):
---------SELECTING THE TEXTURES TO EXPORT---------
- First, make sure you are on the Texture layer in Inkscape
- Next, check and make sure that the Texture layer is unlocked (this can be checked via the lock
icon towards the bottom of inkscape, right next to the dropdown to select layers)
- Now, using the Select tool (the 1st tool in the list on the left side of Inkscape), select all
of the textures that you want to include. This can be done by dragging a box around the textures
using the Select tool. You can tell whether or not this has succeeded by a dotted box surrounding 
the textures that you want to include.
- Now, navigate to File -> Export PNG Image (or Shift+Ctrl+E, if using the default settings on
Inkscape) to get the prompt to export the PNG image.
- Please follow the Dimension Guidelines below when filling out the prompt to export the PNG image

---------DIMENSION GUIDELINES---------
The dimensions of the export format will affect the way the textures on the simulator will render,
so to avoid issues with rendering, please follow the below instructions:
1) Set your units to px
2) Make sure that both your x0 and your y0 fields in the "Export PNG Image" prompt are 0
3) Set both the x1 and y1 fields to the value 4369.067
4) Make sure that both the Width and Height fields under the Export area (NOT under Image size) are 
also set to the value of 4369.067
5) Under the Image size field, make sure that both the Width and Height fields are set to 4096 pixels
at 90.00 dpi
6) Make sure you have the correct filename for your PNG file (for particle.svg, it should be particle.png)
7) Be sure to check the box titled "Hide all except selected" (this will hide the grid and only include the selected textures)
8) Export :)
